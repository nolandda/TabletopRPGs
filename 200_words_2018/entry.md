# CQ
### by Dan Noland 

The Multiverse Transit Network is broken. Once everyone could travel
between universes. Some used technology, others magic. Now everyone is
stuck, but InterDimensional Messaging (IDM) still works.  

Make an IDM: record a video, post it to YouTube, and make a
G+ post. Make the video less than 4 minutes. Extra credit
for costumes, props, or VFX. Tag it #CQTheRPG on G+ so others can
find it and #CQReply.

Make long chains of videos!

When you make an initial #CQCall video you must address:
* Who you are.
* Where you're from.
* Where you're stuck?
* What difficulties you're having?

When you make a #CQReply you must address:
* Your identity
* Difficulties in your situation
* The outcome (see below) of the previous IDM. 
* Answer questions from the IDM and ask some new questions. 
* Explain an unlikely plan to help your interlocutor with their difficulties. Will it work?

Success / failure:
On upload your video gets a VideoId.

Those numbers / letters at the end are the VideoId.  

Does the VideoId have doubled letters next to one another: aa or
-- but not aA. If it has doubles your plan was successful (odds:
~15%). On triples or better (~0.2%) it's amazing.
