# CQ
### by Dan Noland 

Something has gone very very wrong with the Multiverse Transit
Network. Once sentient beings from uncountable universes traveled
between worlds exploring and looking for a better life. Some accessed
the network through technology others by magic. But all these mortal
arts were simply ways of paying the fare to ride the transit network
designed by some power beyond comprehension. Fortunately
interdimentional communication is still possible. Reach out to others
in the multiverse!

To contact others record a short video and post it to YouTube. The
video must be less than 4 minutes in length. You can create a special
YouTube account for playing the game or just use your own. Bonus
points for using costumes / props or even VFX if you have those
skills. When you post the video to YouTube be sure to tag it #CQTheRPG
so others can find it and reply. Also when posting links on Twitter G+
or other social media tag it #CQTheRPG. Tag absolutely everything
#CQTheRPG

There are two types of communications a #CQCall and a #CQReply. #CQCalls
are public broadcasts to anyone that can receive your
transmission. #CQReplies continue the conversation started by a
#CQCall. Make long chains of #CQReplies. The group with the longest
chain is winning.

When you make a #CQCall video you must:
* Explain who you are and where you came from.
* Explain where you have found yourself stuck without access to transit.
* Describe the difficulties you are having in that place. Is it
dangerous? Boring?
* Make a request for some assistance dealing with a specific difficulty. 

When you make a #CQReply you must:
* Identify yourself
* Allude to difficulties in your own situation
* Say what the last video made you think of or feel
* Discuss the success or failure of attempts to help made in the
video you are replying to. If there was actually success it is
noteworthy. Comment on how it has improved things for you.
* Ask at least one question about the character portrayed in the video
to which you are replying.  
* Ask at least one question about the environmental situation
portrayed in the last video.
* Explain something complicated and unlikely to work that you are
doing to alleviate a difficulty in a previous video in the chain. 

Success and failure:
When you upload your video you will get a VideoId. You already know
what this is, you just didn't know it was called a VideoId. Look at
your link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcanVthL8A
That weird string of numbers and letters, -NcanVthL8A, at the end?
That is your VideoId. 

To see how things worked out check the VideoId. Does it contains any
doubles: identical characters right next to one another like aa or --
but not like aA. If you have doubles then somehow whatever you
attempted to help was successful. This won't happen often; only about 15%
of the time. If you get triples or better (0.2% of the time)
something truly amazing and miraculous has happened.
