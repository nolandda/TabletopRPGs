# CQ
### by Dan Noland 

Something is very wrong with the Multiverse Transit Network. Once
beings from uncountable universes traveled between worlds. Some used
technology others magic. Now everyone is stuck, but InterDimensional
Messaging (IDM) still works.  

To send an IDM record a video, post it to YouTube, and make a
G+ post. Make the video less than 4 minutes. Bonus points
for costumes, props, or VFX. Tag it #CQTheRPG on G+ so others can
find it and #CQReply.

Make long chains of videos. The longest chain is winning. 

When you make a #CQCall video to start you must address:
* Who you are.
* Where you came from.
* Where you are stuck?
* What difficulties are you having?

When you make a #CQReply you must address:
* Your identity
* Difficulties in your situation
* The outcome (see below) of the previous IDM. 
* Answer questions from the IDM. 
* Ask a new question about the IDM sender.
* Explain an unlikely plan to help your interlocutor with their difficulties. Will it work?

Success and failure:
When you upload your video you will get a VideoId.

Those numbers and letters at the end? -NcanVthL8A is the VideoId.  

Does the VideoId have doubled letters next to one another: aa or
-- but not aA. If it has doubles your plan was
successful (odds: ~15%). If you get triples or better
(<1%) your success is amazing.
