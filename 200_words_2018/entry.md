# CQ
### by Dan Noland 

Something has gone very wrong with the Multiverse Transit
Network. Once beings from uncountable universes traveled
freely between worlds. Some used technology others magic.
These mortal arts were simply ways of accessing the transit network 
designed by an unknown power. Fortunately interdimentional
communication is still possible 

To contact others record a short video and post it to YouTube. The
video must be less than 4 minutes in length. Bonus points for
costumes, props, or VFX. Be sure to use the tag #CQTheRPG 
(both on YouTube and Social Media) so others can find it and reply.

You can start a new message chain with a #CQCall or search for an
existing chain and make a #CQReply. Make long chains. The group with
the longest chain is winning. 

When you make a #CQCall video to you must address:
* Who you are.
* Where you came from.
* Where are you stuck currently?
* What difficulties are you having there?
* Request assistance dealing with a difficulty. 

When you make a #CQReply you must address:
* Your identity
* Discuss difficulties in your own situation
* What impression did the previous message make on you? 
* Did the previous message have any success (see below)? If so how are
you better off?
* Ask at least one question about your interlocutor.
* Ask at least one question about their situation.
* Explain something complicated and unlikely to work that you are
attempting to help your interlocutor with their difficulties.

Success and failure:
When you upload your video you will get a VideoId.

That weird string of numbers and letters, -NcanVthL8A, at the end is
your VideoId.  

Check the VideoId. Does it contain any doubled letters next to one
another: like aa or -- but not like aA. If it has doubles then your
attempted to help was successful. This is unlikely (~15%). If you get
triples or better (0.2%) your success is amazing.
