# CQ
### by Dan Noland 

Something has gone very wrong with the Multiverse Transit
Network. Once beings from uncountable universes traveled
freely between worlds. Some used technology others magic.
These mortal arts were simply ways of accessing the transit network 
designed by an unknown power. Fortunately interdimentional
communication is still possible 

To contact others record a short video and post it to YouTube. The
video must be less than 4 minutes in length. Bonus points for
costumes, props, or VFX. Be sure to use the tag #CQTheRPG 
(both on YouTube and Social Media) so others can find it and reply.

You can start a new message chain with a #CQCall or search for an
existing chain and make a #CQReply. Make long chains. The group with
the longest chain is winning. 

When you make a #CQCall video to you must:
* Explain who you are and where you came from.
* Explain where you have found yourself stuck without access to transit.
* Describe the difficulties you are having in that place.
* Make a request for some assistance dealing with a specific difficulty. 

When you make a #CQReply you must:
* Identify yourself
* Allude to difficulties in your own situation
* Say what the last video made you think of or feel
* Discuss the success or failure of attempts to help made in the
video you are replying to. If there was actually success comment on how it has improved things for you.
* Ask at least one question about the character portrayed in the video
to which you are replying.  
* Ask at least one question about the environmental situation
portrayed in the last video.
* Explain something complicated and unlikely to work that you are
doing to alleviate a difficulty in a previous video in the chain. 

Success and failure:
When you upload your video you will get a VideoId. Look at the link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcanVthL8A
That weird string of numbers and letters, -NcanVthL8A, at the end?
That is your VideoId. 

To see how things worked out check the VideoId. Does it contain any
doubled letters next to one another: like aa or -- but not like aA. If
you have doubles then your attempted to help was successful. This
won't happen often; only about 15% of the time. If you get triples or
better (0.2% of the time) something truly amazing and miraculous has
happened.
