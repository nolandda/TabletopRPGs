\section{Text}

The crash was violent and unexpected. Your coma is
deep. Your memories are missing or scrambled. But your mind has begun
to stir. 

One Psyche: Learn about yourself and chose a path forward.

Three Shades: Visions of people known in the Psyche's life.
Prudence: Bring the psyche back to their current life.
Dynamism: Lead the psyche to radically change their life.
Death: Take the psyche beyond this life.

Each Shade will take one of three forms: Blood relation, close friend, lover. 

Prudence's form is a current friend, lover, or family member.
Dynamism's form is a friend, lover, or family member that the psyche
remembers fondly has lost contact with.
Death's form is a friend, lover, or family member who has already died.

Setup: Ask the player of the psyche to leave the room. Place three
different coins in a bag. Each of the Shades first 
draws a coin to determine their true nature they keep this coin hidden
in their left hand. A new set of three coins is placed in the bag and
each spectre draws again in reverse order to determine their demeanor.   

High Coin:  Prudence, Family
Middle Coin: Dynamism, Lover
Low Coin: Death, Friend

Write the following questions on cards and flip four coins in order to
learn some things about the psyche. Heads: yes, Tails: no.

Am I important / successful?
Are my best years behind me?
Am I happy?
Do I have the love I need?

Quickly discuss what this means about the psyche. What kind of person
are they (prudence)? What are their secret hopes and dreams
(dynamism)? 
Cover the results of the coin flips with the cards. Invite the
psyche's player back into the room. 

Give the psyche two memory coins.

Play

Each of the shades approach the psyche in turn. The first time around
the Shade frames an introduction scene where they recall the first
time they met the psyche. 

Shades: frame scenes in turn. Flash back to important shared
memories, present visions of futures. Say anything to get the psyche
to take your hand and follow you. Lie shamelessly. Accuse the other shades
of being liars. When forced to reveal a truth try to reveal the one
that best bolsters your case.

Psyche: Be genuinely curious. Learn about your life. Demand
answers. Get to the bottom of inconsistancies. What was your life
like? Is it worth returning to? You were given two memory coins. Give
one to a shade during a scence to demand a true answer. They will
reveal a truth by uncovering a card, but maybe not the card you
requested. 

When the psyche has spent their second coin each of the shades gets
one more scent to make their case. Then the psyche must chose who to
follow.

Denouement

Learn your fate from your chosen shade. Will you return to your life?
Start a new life in this world or the next? What is it like? What
happens to your family and friends? Work with the shades (in
particular the one you chose) to wrap up the story. Have them take on
roles of ``real'' people and play out a final scenes if necessary.
