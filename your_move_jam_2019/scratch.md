# Your Move Jam 2019

## Statement
Introducing the Your Move Jam - a chance for mechanical minimalism and accessible design. The idea is to create a game where your only mechanic is one, single move as loosely defined by Apocalypse World and other Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) games.  

One move is all you've got, though feel free to add in as much fictional information as you'd like. Other common PbtA elements, like character archetypes, principles, experience, and countdown clocks are, well... some people would absolutely consider those mechanics, others would consider them world building. Feel free to include those if you don't consider them mechanics. Or include them if you do consider them mechanics. Or maybe even tie them in to be part of your move. 

## Ideas

* The moves affect a Markov graph drawn on the table?
